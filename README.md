# Data Analytics End-to-End Project (Python, SQL, Power BI)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from raw data loading to insight generation and dashboard visualization. It covers data exploration, cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and interactive reporting using Power BI. The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills used in real-world business scenarios.

## Dataset

* Source: Public / Sample dataset
* Format: CSV
* Description: The dataset contains customer and transaction-related information used to analyze purchasing behavior, trends, and performance metrics.

Key fields include:

* Customer details
* Purchase amounts
* Categories and frequency
* Ratings and other relevant attributes

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Python (Data processing and analysis)
* Pandas, NumPy (EDA and data cleaning)
* SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
* Power BI (Dashboard and visualization)
* Gamma (PPT / report generation)

---

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading

* Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas
* Performed initial inspection and structure checks

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed data distributions and patterns
* Identified missing values and outliers
* Generated summary statistics

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing and inconsistent data
* Removed duplicates
* Standardized formats for analysis

### 4. SQL Analysis

* Imported cleaned data into SQL database
* Wrote queries to answer business questions
* Performed aggregations, filtering, and joins

### 5. Power BI Dashboard

* Built an interactive dashboard
* Displayed KPIs such as customer count, average purchase value, and ratings
* Added filters and visuals for better insights

### 6. Reporting

* Created a professional PPT report using Gamma
* Summarized insights, trends, and recommendations
